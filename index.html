&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, Im Jean Desruisseaux and this is my page.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a freshman at the University at Buffalo. I was  born on May 15, 1998 and am from Brookyn, NY.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose to major in Computer Science for several reasons. My first dream was to major in Game Design, so I
thought I would teach myself a few things early on.&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoyed writing the script for all the events to be triggered by


the player, the graphic animations to move on cue, and the such, but I realized there was much more I wanted to do; Web


Design also fascinated me, as well as the many different programming languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I decided to get a small dose of


everything by majoring in Computer Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, I am enjoying HTML the most, since web design was one of the things


I wanted to do the most.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, that's not what I wan't me career to be, because how can I make a steady income


off of building websites?&nbsp;&nbsp;It would make a better side job rather than as a main career.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in my free time though, I


brainstorm ideas for small games for mobile devices, or even an entire RPG with simple graphics for the computer.
